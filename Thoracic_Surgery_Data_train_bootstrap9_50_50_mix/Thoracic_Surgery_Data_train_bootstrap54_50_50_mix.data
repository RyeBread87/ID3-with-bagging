// The structure of this dataset is described below.
// (we're using a very restricted design for simplicity).

// You can visit
//    http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Thoracic+Surgery+Data
// to see more about this dataset.

// NOTE: Your code should handle both Windows-formatted and Linux-formatted files
// (which, unfortunately, differ in how the end of line is represented).

// Your code should HANDLE ANY AMOUNT OF 'white space,' including blank lines, BETWEEN TOKENS.

// Note that you only need to handle '//' comments (ie, there will be no "/* */" comments.
// It is easy in Java to the contents of a string BEFORE any '//' (might get the empty string,
// which should also be ignored).

// The number of features:
31

// Next are the feature names followed by a dash and then the legal values of this feature
// In the CS 540 programming HWs related to decision trees, we will assume that all features have
// two possible values, though they might have names other than the T and F used here (eg,
// might have: "size - small big" in some other testbed used during grading).

// Converted DGN from ONE feature with SEVEN legal values to SEVEN Boolean-valued features.

// The original fields, copied verbatim from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Thoracic+Surgery+Data

/////////////////////////////

// The number of examples (will read this many in; ok to have more in the file)
90

// The examples (as mentioned above, we assume, for simplicity, that all features are BOOLEAN-VALUED, 
// *though the names of the two values might differ across datasets*)

//   First is the example's name, then its category, finally followed
//   by the values of all of its features (listed in the order of the
//   feature names above, will be separated by "whitespace"). 
//   The (boring) names are simply used to concisely identify the examples.
//   Your decision-tree learner should NOT use these names as a feature (what would happen if you did?).
